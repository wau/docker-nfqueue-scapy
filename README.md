# docker-nfqueue-scapy

Docker container with an example python script to listen for packets on
a netfilter queue and manipulate them with scapy. You can listen on any queue number, and you can push packets into the queue from any iptables rule. 
This container gives you a powerful prototyping and debugging tool for monitoring, manipulating, dropping, accepting, requeing, or forwarding network packets in python.
You can read from a queue on the host with `--net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN`.
 Or, you can run it within another container's namespace to listen
for packets on an nfqueue in that container's network namespace.

This container includes a full installation of scapy and python netfilter queue
(nfqueue) bindings, and an example python script `nfqueue_listener.py` to
print incoming packets on the queue.

## How to use

Clone this repository

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:milesrichardson/docker-nfqueue-scapy.git
```

Build the docker container. This will take a while because it includes the
full scapy install and all its dependencies. You can use any tag you want, but
as an example here I'm using `nfqueuelistener`

``` shell
cd docker-nfqueue-scapy
sudo docker build . -t nfqueuelistener
```

(Example)

Use `iptables` on the host to send TCP packets destined for port `9001`
to nfqueue `1`:

``` shell
sudo iptables -t raw \
              -A PREROUTING \
              -p tcp --destination-port 9001 \
              -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 1
```

Run the docker container to listen for packets and print then accept any
received packets.

``` shell
sudo docker run -it --rm \
                --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
                --net=host \
                --name=nfqueuelistener nfqueuelistener
```

From another machine, send some packets to test:

``` shell
echo "Hello" | nc -v $HOST_IP_ADDRESS 9001
```

You should see something like this:

``` shell
miles@box:~/testing$ sudo docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --net=host --name=nfqueuelistener nfqueuelistener
Listening on NFQUEUE queue-num 1...
<IP  version=4L ihl=5L tos=0x0 len=64 id=6387 flags=DF frag=0L ttl=55 proto=tcp chksum=0x6850 src=11.22.33.44 dst=44.55.66.77 options=[] |<TCP  sport=58164 dport=9001 seq=4038873318 ack=0 dataofs=11L reserved=0L flags=S window=65535 chksum=0x67be urgptr=0 options=[('MSS', 1452), ('NOP', None), ('WScale', 5), ('NOP', None), ('NOP', None), ('Timestamp', (2615879909, 0)), ('SAckOK', ''), ('EOL', None)] |>>
```

## Setting the queue number

The default queue number is `1`. You can override this by setting the environment variable
`QUEUE_NUM` when running the container. For example, for queue `2`:

``` shell
sudo docker run -it --rm \
                -e 'QUEUE_NUM=2' \
                --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
                --net=host \
                --name=nfqueuelistener nfqueuelistener
```

## Editing the `nfqueue_listener.py` file

One way to edit the `nfqueue_listener.py` file is to simply edit it and then rebuild
the container with `sudo docker build . -t nfqueuelistener`. Since you are only
editing the python file, building will not take as long as the first build.

You can find the documentation for the nfqueue library used at https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue

## Listening in another container's namespace

I have not tested this, but it should work.

Say you have another container `$CONTAINER_ID` and you want to intercept incoming
packets in its namespace. You can run this docker container like:

``` shell
sudo docker run -it --rm \
                --net=container:$CONTAINER_ID \
                --name=nfqueuelistener nfqueuelistener
```

Note that you will need to run your `iptables` rules to send packets to the queue
from within the `$CONTAINER_ID` container.
